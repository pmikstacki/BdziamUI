# Bdziam.UI 

Bdziam.UI is a Blazor-based UI framework that adheres to Material Design 3 (M3) guidelines. It provides a growing library of components designed for intuitive, accessible, and visually consistent user interfaces. 

## üöß Project Status: Discontinued, but not done for!
After much consideration I've decided that writing all of material from scratch is too much for my current load in other projects, but I am planning to use the Dynamic Color port to style mudblazor, stay tuned ~~

## ‚ú® Features  
- Blazor components built for Material Design 3.  
- Modular architecture for flexible UI development.  
- Supports Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly.  
- Fully customizable components with C# code-behind files.  

## üîß Installation  
Bdziam.UI is now available in NuGet!
```bash  

dotnet add package Bdziam.UI

```  

Include the project in your Blazor solution, and add the necessary CSS and script files for Material Design 3 to your ` src/Bdziam.UI/wwwroot/ ` folder.
